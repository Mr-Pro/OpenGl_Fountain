This project is based on Computer Graphics and Visualization. 
This a simple demonstration of graphics using OPENGL. 
GL libraries are used to make the project. 
The demonstration consisted of some particles whose movements are controlled by the laws of gravity thus, producing the effect of a waterfall or a fountain. 
Spheres are created with the help of structures in c.
With the help of the mouse a 3D view of the project is developed. This project on OPENGL is keyboard and mouse driven.
